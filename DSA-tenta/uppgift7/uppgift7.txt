BUBBLE

Here is a simpler version of the bubble sort algorithm in pseudo code:


procedure bubbleSort(arr)
    n = length(arr)
    for i = 0 to n-1
        for j = 0 to n-i-1
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]
                swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
    end procedure
This version of the algorithm uses nested for loops to repeatedly compare and swap adjacent 
elements in the array. It starts at the beginning of the array and repeatedly steps 
through the array until it reaches the end, comparing each element to the one next to it 
and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. 
As before, the algorithm gets its name from the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" 
to the top of the list as the sort progresses.

DAC 

Please explain DAC in an easy way 

DAC stands for "Divide and Conquer." It's a general problem-solving strategy that involves 
breaking a complex problem down into smaller, simpler subproblems that can be solved independently. 
The solutions to these subproblems are then combined to create a solution to the original problem.

Think of it like a recipe, where you want to make a cake. 
You first break down the recipe into smaller parts such as making the batter, 
baking the cake and then making the icing. 
Each of these parts can be done independently and once they are completed you 
combine them together to make a complete cake.

This approach is useful when dealing with large or complex problems that are difficult to 
solve as a whole. It allows you to focus on solving one small piece of the problem at a time, 
which can make it easier to find a solution. 
It is also a powerful technique for designing algorithms and can be used to develop efficient 
solutions for a wide range of problems, such as sorting and searching.

Examples of algorithms that use the divide-and-conquer strategy include merge sort and quick 
sort for sorting, and the Karatsuba algorithm and the Schonhage-Strassen algorithm for multiplication.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MERGE 

Here is an even simpler version of the merge sort algorithm in pseudo code:

procedure mergeSort(arr)
    if arr.length > 1
        middle = arr.length / 2
        left = arr[0..middle]
        right = arr[middle..arr.length]
        mergeSort(left)
        mergeSort(right)
        arr = merge(left, right)
    end if
end procedure

function merge(left, right)
    result = []
    i, j = 0, 0
    while i < left.length and j < right.length
        if left[i] <= right[j]
            result.append(left[i])
            i = i + 1
        else
            result.append(right[j])
            j = j + 1
    while i < left.length
        result.append(left[i])
        i = i + 1
    while j < right.length
        result.append(right[j])
        j = j + 1
    return result
end function

This version of the merge sort algorithm still follows the divide-and-conquer strategy, 
where the input array is recursively split into two halves until each half contains only one element. 
Then the two halves are merged back together in sorted order.

The merge process is done by initializing two pointers i, j to the beginning of left, right subarrays, 
respectively. It compares the elements of both left and right subarrays and puts the smaller 
one in the result array and increases the pointer for that subarray. 
This process continues till one subarray is completely traversed and then the remaining 
elements of the other array are appended to the result array.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(nlogn) and is a stable sort. 
The implementation is even more simple, it uses less lines of code, less variables, 
and loops, making it easy to understand.

PHILIPPES MERGE Pseudocode

step 1: start
step 2: declare array and left, right, mid variable
step 3: perform merge function.
    if left > right
        return
    mid= (left+right)/2
    mergesort(array, left, mid)
    mergesort(array, mid+1, right)
    merge(array, left, mid, right)
step 4: Stop
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK-SORT

procedure quicksort(left, right)
   if left < right
      pivot_index := partition(left, right)
      quicksort(left, pivot_index)
      quicksort(pivot_index + 1, right)

procedure partition(left, right)
   pivot := array[left]
   i := left + 1
   j := right
   while i <= j
      if array[i] <= pivot
         i := i + 1
      else if array[j] > pivot
         j := j - 1
      else
         swap array[i] with array[j]
   swap array[left] with array[j]
   return j

This is a basic quicksort algorithm using the "left" and "right" elements as pivot points. 
The partition function is used to divide the array into two sub-arrays, 
one less than the pivot and one greater than the pivot, 
and the quicksort function is then recursively called on each sub-array.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
procedure quicksort(array)
   if length(array) < 2
      return array
   pivot := array[0]
   less := [x in array if x < pivot]
   greater := [x in array if x > pivot]
   return quicksort(less) + [pivot] + quicksort(greater)
