Att kunna omvandla ett bin√§rtal till ett decimal tal och vice versa

It's not complex: all you need to do is use the modulus and divide operators until there is no number left:

1) Set inp to binary number.
2) Set digit to inp modulus 10. Output digit
3) Set inp to inp divided by 10
4) If inp is not zero, repeat from (2)

The only complication is that this generates the digits in the wrong order: 
least significant first. So you will need to make your "Output Digit" cope with that, 
and probably store them in reverse order for output at the end. Exactly how you do that 
isn't complex, but I don't know how far you have got in your course, so I won't suggest anything
 - you have probably got an idea from the lecture that this was the homework from.

For Example: 
If the decimal number is 10. 
Step 1: Remainder when 10 is divided by 2 is zero. Therefore, arr[0] = 0. 
Step 2: Divide 10 by 2. New number is 10/2 = 5. 
Step 3: Remainder when 5 is divided by 2 is 1. Therefore, arr[1] = 1. 
Step 4: Divide 5 by 2. New number is 5/2 = 2. 
Step 5: Remainder when 2 is divided by 2 is zero. Therefore, arr[2] = 0. 
Step 6: Divide 2 by 2. New number is 2/2 = 1. 
Step 7: Remainder when 1 is divided by 2 is 1. Therefore, arr[3] = 1. 
Step 8: Divide 1 by 2. New number is 1/2 = 0. 
Step 9: Since number becomes = 0. Print the array in reverse order. 
Therefore the equivalent binary number is 1010.
